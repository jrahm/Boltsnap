The versioning in Boltsnap is a three numbered versioning system e.g. 0.02.04

The last number, or least significant number is the day of the last relatively
major revision.

The second to last number is the month of the last relatively major revision where
January=1, February=2 ...

The most significant number is the number of the last release.

If new year's day occurs before a release, then the second number is the current month
plus 12. If new years day comes twice before a release, then the second number is the
current month plus 24 and so on and so fourth.

After a major release, the second number resets to 1.

So version 5.14.22 would have been released on February 22nd and it would have been
over a full calendar year since version 4 was released.
